Key Concept - Be able to create a class and instantiate that class using a constructor

Key Concept - Be able to reduce repeated code by chaining constructors

Key Concept - Demonstrate the above skills by completing the challenge exercise

Reflect on what you have learnt

## Semantics 

| Word | definition|
|---|---|
|class|	an extensible program-code-template for creating objects	|
|object	|	a region of memory that contains values and are referenced by identifiers|
