## Splitting strings

Using the *".Split"* suffix, spaces can be used to seperate a string of text into an array, where each element is a word.

For example :

```console
User Input :
"Uni of Hull Computer Science"
```
```cs
string input = Console.ReadLine();

string[] separateStrings = input.Split(' ');

for (int i = 0; i < separateStrings.Length; i++) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(separateStrings[i]);
}
```
```console
Console Output:
Uni
of
Hull
Computer Science
```
