# Summative Assessment 2 - Making Decisions Using Conditionals

This assessment is summative - which means that you get feedback for completing this, and marks from this work count towards your final mark for this portfolio.

## ToDo List

- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate the use of Boolean types, and relational and logical operators.](#boolean)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate how a conditional statement is used to control the flow of execution of code.](#conditional-statements)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate an understanding of the order of evaluation of conditions in if â€“ else if statements and nested conditional statements.](#nested-conditions)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate the use of debugging tools in Visual Studio.](#debugging)
- 
- [ ] [:speech_balloon: Express new semantics](#semantics)
- [ ] [:thought_balloon: Reflect on what you have learnt](#reflection)
- [ ] [:question: Request feedback (optional)](#requesting-feedback)
- [ ] :white_check_mark: Get your work checked off by a feedback engineer

## Boolean

## Conditional Statements

## Nested Conditions

## Debugging

## Requesting Feedback

This section is optional, but encouraged. Feedback is crucial to the learning process. If you have any questions about what you have learnt this week record them here for your demonstrator to answer. **Replace** the bullet points below with any questions you might have.
- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning of life?

## Semantics

In order to talk about programming we need to establish a set of core terminology, or "semantics". In this context "semantics" means the words we use to talk about programming. This is different to Syntax, which is what we type to tell the computer what we want it do to. It is important that when we use words that have
a special meaning in the context of programming we share a common understanding.

Complete this table of semantics with your understanding of what these terms mean:

| Word | Synonyms | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
|Boolean|logic|true or false|
|Condition|parameter| phrase used to determine true or false |
|Code Block| code sectoin | a group of declarations and statements that operates as a unit|
|Scope| work area| the area in which a code block operates|
|Relational Operator| comparison operator | compares two values|
|Logical Operator| binary operator | compares true or false |
|Break Point| pause point| a point that can pause/stop the running od code |
|Step Through| resume points | skip past the break point to continue witht he code|
|Nested Condition| if elif else | an operator that provides multiple paths with specific condtions |


## Reflection
In this section you should reflect upon what you have learnt. This is an important part of the learning process.
- What have you learnt from these exercises?
- How can you apply what you have learnt?
- What new features of C# are you now able to use?
