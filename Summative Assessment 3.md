# Summative Assessment 3 - Repeating Behavious Using Loops

This assessment is summative - which means that you get feedback for completing this, and marks from this work count towards your final mark for this portfolio.

## ToDo List

- [ ] [:key: Can describe with examples how a while loop and a do-while loop work, and the difference between them](#do-while-and-while-loops)
- [ ] [:key: Can describe with examples what the break and continue keywords do](#break-and-continue)
- [ ] [:key: Can describe with examples what a nested loop is](#nested-loops)
- [ ] [:speech_balloon: Express new semantics](#semantics)
- [ ] [:thought_balloon: Reflect on what you have learnt](#reflection)
- [ ] [:question: Request feedback (optional)](#requesting-feedback)
- [ ] :white_check_mark: Get your work checked off by a feedback engineer

## Do While and While Loops

## Break and Continue

## Nested Loops

## Requesting Feedback

This section is optional, but encouraged. Feedback is crucial to the learning process. If you have any questions about what you have learnt this week record them here for your demonstrator to answer. **Replace** the bullet points below with any questions you might have.
- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning of life?

## Semantics

In order to talk about programming we need to establish a set of core terminology, or "semantics". In this context "semantics" means the words we use to talk about programming. This is different to Syntax, which is what we type to tell the computer what we want it do to. It is important that when we use words that have
a special meaning in the context of programming we share a common understanding.

Complete this table of semantics with your understanding of what these terms mean:

| Word | Synonyms | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

## Reflection
In this section you should reflect upon what you have learnt. This is an important part of the learning process.
- What have you learnt from these exercises?
- How can you apply what you have learnt?
- What new features of C# are you now able to use?
