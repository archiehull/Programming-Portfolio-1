# Summative Assessment 3 - Repeating Behavious Using Loops

This assessment is summative - which means that you get feedback for completing this, and marks from this work count towards your final mark for this portfolio.

## ToDo List

- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate the ability to declare, access and modify the contents of arrays.](#declaring-arrays)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate the ability to iterate over arrays.](#iterating-arrays)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate an understanding of why arrays are reference types, what reference type means and the implications of that.](#reference-types)
- [ ] [:key: Demonstrate the ability to how to use a multidimensional array.](#multidimentional-arrays)

- [ ] [:speech_balloon: Express new semantics](#semantics)
- [ ] [:thought_balloon: Reflect on what you have learnt](#reflection)

- [ ] :white_check_mark: Get your work checked off by a feedback engineer

## Declaring Arrays

## Semantics

| Word | Synonyms | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
|Array| | |
|“contiguous in memory”| | |
|Element| | |
|Index| | |
|Reference type / Managed by reference| | |
|Value type / Managed by value| | |
|For each| | |
|Out of bounds| | |

## Reflection

In this section you should reflect upon what you have learnt. This is an important part of the learning process.
- What have you learnt from these exercises?



- How can you apply what you have learnt?



- What new features of C# are you now able to use?
